# Deep-Learning-Based-Social-Distance-Monitoring-Framework-For-COVID-19-Safety-Guidelines
This deep learning based framework automates the task of monitoring social distancing using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the SSD (Single Shot object Detection) model to segregate humans from the background and Deep sort approach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes. Later, the pairwise Euclidean distance is computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index term is proposed to quantize the nonadaptation of social distancing protocol. The article proposes an efficient real-time deep learning based framework to automate the process of monitoring the social distancing via object detection, where each individual is identified in the real-time with the help of bounding boxes. The generated bounding boxes aid in identifying the clusters or groups of people satisfying the closeness property computed with the help of pairwise Euclidean distance approach.
